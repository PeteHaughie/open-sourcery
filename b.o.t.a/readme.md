## About the B.O.T.A

From the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.O.T.A._tarot_deck

The B.O.T.A. Tarot was created by Paul Foster Case, founder of B.O.T.A. and artist Jessie Burns Parke. Although it is based upon, and for the most part closely resembles, Arthur Edward Waite's 1910 Rider-Waite deck, Case changed what he said were mistakes or "blinds" on part of Waite. The B.O.T.A. Tarot is presented in several editions: the standard-sized full deck and a larger version containing only the Major Arcana (trump cards; often called 'tarot keys' by Case) are black and white, since Case believed that every student needed to color their own deck. After his death, the Major Arcana became also available in color. Each of these cards has a border of a particular color, which is the color that is associated with the card in the writings of Case.

Every trump card has a Hebrew letter written on it in the lower right corner, which is the letter that is associated with the card in the writings of Case. In contrast to some earlier occult tarot decks, which place the fool card last in order, and associate it with the second-to-last Hebrew letter, shin (such decks order the last Hebrew letter, tav, before shin), the B.O.T.A. deck places the fool card first in order, and therefore associates it with the first Hebrew letter, aleph. It also orders shin before tav, in the correct order of Hebrew letters.
